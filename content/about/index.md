# About Me

My name is Hans aka Slims, and I'm just a regular dude. My hobbies are playing sports (soccer/football, skiing, swimming, running, anything else when I get the chance), playing/losing in chess, reading, classical guitar and other small minor things.

I have wanted a semi-anonymous blog for some time, something a bit less serious
than my personal blog (for my family) and my professional blog (which doesn't exist
as of writing, just in my head).

By profession I work as a developer in Japan, doing mostly frontend work, but
occasionally some backend-ish, cloud-ish work.
